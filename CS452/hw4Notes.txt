Create algorithm in user space then make it part of the kernel so debugging isn't so terrible

drivers are under /dev
Open driver for read/WRITE
    write with write() or printf()
    read with read() or getline()
    ioctl() manipulates the io device
    Code to write will include:
        Generate token from a string using a tokenizer
        Output tokens one at a time
        Separators can take a string and any character in that string will be a Separator
        
    Copy Hello.c and make it Scanner.c
    don't use kmalloc at the beginning, just use malloc
    Get rid of all driver stuff until algorithm is made
