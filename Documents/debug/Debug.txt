Bug #1:
    -What's the name of failed test?
	testIsEmpty()
    -Where (line number) did you place breakpoint(s)? 
	40
    -Where (line number) was the bug was found?
	40
    -What did you do to fix it?
	I fixed the logic with the return statement to == 0 instead of > 0 because if rear is 0, the array doesn't have anything in it

Bug #2:
    -What's the name of failed test?
	testAdd_Element()
    -Where (line number) did you place breakpoint(s)? 
	55
    -Where (line number) was the bug was found?
	60
    -What did you do to fix it?
	I added a rear++ because the rear variable was never getting edited once it was set, and it needed to be added to after adding an element to the array

Bug #3:
    -What's the name of failed test?
	testRemove_validElements()
    -Where (line number) did you place breakpoint(s)? 
	74
    -Where (line number) was the bug was found?
	74
    -What did you do to fix it?
	I made sure the while statement's condition was i < rear - 1 instead of i < rear because there was an arrayIndexOutOfBounds error thrown
